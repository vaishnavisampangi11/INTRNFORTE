#  INTERNFORTE Internship Projects

Welcome! This repository contains the projects I developed during my **INTERNFORTE Internship**, where I worked on both **C++ (Data Structures)** and **Python** projects. Each project helped me strengthen core programming skills, logical thinking, and hands-on coding experience.

##  Data Structures  Projects 

###  1. Student Information System
A simple student database management system using **singly linked lists** in C++.

**Features:**
- Add, search, modify, delete student records
- Display all student details
- Menu-driven interaction

**Concepts Used:**  
Linked Lists, Dynamic Memory, Structs, Pointers

**Future Scope:**  
Add file saving, sorting, and a basic GUI interface.

###  2. Bus Reservation System
A C++ program that allows users to manage a bus reservation system using **OOP and vectors**.

**Features:**
- Add new buses with driver info, route, and time
- Book seats for passengers (with seat validation)
- Display seat availability and all bus details

**Concepts Used:**  
Classes, Objects, Vectors, Structures, Encapsulation

**Future Scope:**  
Search buses by destination, save bookings to files.

##  Python Projects

###  3. Random Password Generator
A Python program to generate **secure passwords** with customizable options.

**Features:**
- User sets length (minimum 10 characters)
- Option to include numbers and special characters
- Random secure passwords using the `random` and `string` modules

**Concepts Used:**  
`random.choice()`, `string.ascii_letters`, input validation, conditions

**Future Scope:**  
Add GUI, encrypt and store passwords, check password strength.

###  4. Hangman Game
A fun Python-based **word guessing game** played in the terminal.

**Features:**
- Random word selection from a list
- Tracks correct/incorrect guesses
- Feedback after each guess
- Game ends in win/loss

**Concepts Used:**  
Loops, Conditions, Sets, String Manipulation, Input Validation

**Future Scope:**  
Add GUI, multiplayer mode, more word variety.

##  Technologies Used
- **Languages:** C++, Python
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub
- **Topics:** Data Structures, OOP, Logic Building
